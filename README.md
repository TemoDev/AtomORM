# AtomORM

So here I am trying to build some kind of simple ORM on top of the ADO.NET library. Some might think it's just a cheap copy of EF Core, well it might... but at least it's a fun project to build. 

## Core features

- [ ] Database connection management: Create a class to manage database connections using ADO.NET 
- [ ] Mapping: map C# classes to database tables.
- [ ] Querying: design a query API that translates method calls into SQL queries.(Basically LINQ to SQL translator)
- [ ] CRUD operations: implement basic operations.

### Disclaimer 
I have absolutly no idea how to build this. <3
